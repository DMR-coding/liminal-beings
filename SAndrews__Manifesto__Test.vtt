00:00:03.645 --> 00:00:06.834
My manifesto is a love letter to a future that is shared.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.622
To a place and time where we all belong. And to a persisting moment where everyone can still dream.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.068
In this future there is empathy.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.102
There is reflection, and introspection.

00:00:16.194 --> 00:00:18.091
And with that, mourning and forgiveness.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.028
There is so much warmth, almost enough to fry an egg.

00:00:21.314 --> 00:00:24.742
It's a little painful but still comforting and comfortable in its own way.

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:29.325
This warmth is often found in small nooks that can somehow fit and hug everyone and everything.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.057
And then, there is a deep respect for the world, and for each other, and for truth and sincerity;

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.834
a time for vulnerability, and for an awareness and desire to understand and bridge deep disparities in communities within and beyond our own.

00:00:41.177 --> 00:00:43.737
There is a care and hope for every community as our own.

00:00:44.365 --> 00:00:47.611
There is also the privilege of time, and a bit of magic in the everyday.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.348
An appreciation and cherishing of both the mundane and the extraordinary.

00:00:51.748 --> 00:00:56.194
A mindfulness of the persisting impact of our actions and intentions across all scales.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.554
I think it can be truly challenging not to feel crushed by the pains of our world today.

00:01:01.851 --> 00:01:09.257
To hide away and wait for it to all be over if we’re lucky, or be consumed in navigating this new landscape of isolation, despair, and uncertainty.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.348
What I hope most to keep in mind in these days ahead is this shared future —

00:01:13.497 --> 00:01:20.617
how do we continue moving toward a place where we all belong, and all listen and hear and respond and are supported now and beyond these moments in time?

00:01:21.142 --> 00:01:23.291
How do we take care of ourselves and each other?

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.994
Thank you

00:01:26.502 --> 00:01:39.874
